Scatter Plots:

    MajorAxisLength vs. MinorAxisLength: Explore the relationship between major and minor axis lengths.
    Area vs. Perimeter: Visualize how area and perimeter are distributed.
    Eccentricity vs. AspectRatio: Examine the eccentricity in relation to the aspect ratio.

Histograms:

    Distribution of Area, Perimeter, MajorAxisLength, MinorAxisLength, etc.
    Class distribution: Show the number of samples for each class.

Box Plots:

    Compare the statistical distribution of various features across different classes.

Correlation Heatmap:

    Explore correlations between different features in the dataset.

Pie Chart or Bar Chart:

    Display the distribution of classes in the dataset.
